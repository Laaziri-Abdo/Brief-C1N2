                <p>I was an ENT for many years before joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                    the tree intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                    successfully switched careers. working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. â€¢</p>

                <p>Before joining the bootcamp, lwe
                    never written a line of code. I needed
                    some structure from professionals
                    who can help me learn programming
                    step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs
                    who can only say wonderful things
                    about the program. The entire
                    curriculum and staff did not
                    disappoint. They were very hands-on
                    and I never had to wait long tor
                    assistance. The agile team project, in
                    particular, was outstanding. It took
                    my learning to the next level ina way
                    that no tutorial could ever have. In
                    fact. I've often referred to it during
                    interviews as an example of my
                    developent experience. It certainly
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack
                    developer after receiving multiple
                    offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
